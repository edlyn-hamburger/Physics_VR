***SOFTWARE BEING USED***
~~Unity 2021.3.18f1~~
Unity 2022.3.6f1
Blender (any recent version)

***Notes of Work***
12/18/23 -- Built and imported better building model in Blender, found free cabinet assets in unity store. They have built in animation so I believe they can be scripted to be interactble. Did not do test build.

1/3/24 -- Imported project into new Unity version

***TO DO***
Script Cabinets to be interacble
Aestheticize

**MISC**
Unity Link must be set up for Oculus to work with play button otherwise must make a build to device

~~Do not include test builds in git file~~
apk packages were in gitignore file

~~If probuilder keeps making unity crash update or uninstall and reintall~~
Probuilder sucks ass use at own risk, use blender for more dynamic editing 

When using blender for models make sure scaling is correct otherwise object's scale will be in the hundrends or thousands
