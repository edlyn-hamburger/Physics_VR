***SOFTWARE BEING USED***
~~Unity 2021.3.18f1~~
Unity 2022.3.6f1
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/
Blender (any recent version)

***Notes of Work***
12/18/23 -- Built and imported better building model in Blender, found free cabinet assets in unity store. They have built in animation so I believe they can be scripted to be interactble. Did not do test build.

1/3/24 -- Imported project into new Unity version

1/8/24 -- Worked on main scene, added grass and a door to building

1/9/24 -- More modeling and simple scripting. Scripting was more to get used to the syntax than anything else

***TO DO***
Build scene/level
Add more assests
Aestheticize (add textures)
Fork main repo for me and victor
Script Cabinets to be interacble
Racetrack with *Free Body Diagrams* (edlyn)
Pendulm (victor)
Try to set up unity link (not big priority)

**MISC**
Unity Link must be set up for Oculus to work with play button otherwise must make a build to device

Unity Link seems to only work or is more stable on windows 10 

~~Do not include test builds in git file~~
apk packages were in gitignore file

~~If probuilder keeps making unity crash update or uninstall and reintall~~
Probuilder sucks ass use at own risk, use blender for more dynamic editing 

When using blender for models make sure scaling is correct otherwise object's scale will be in the hundrends or thousands
